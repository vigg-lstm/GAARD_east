Four samples had universally high relatedness values to all samples. The relatedness values attributables to these four samples have been respectively coloured in pink, yellow, green and red on the histogram. \textbf{B} Histogram of heterozygosity values across all samples, showing that the same four samples (coloured and indicated with arrows) have elevated heterozygosity.

Only CNV alleles with frequency > 0\% are shown. Cell darkness provided as a visual aid for the magnitude of the value in each cell. The genomic coordinates of each CNV allele can be found in Supplementary Data S@. In each cluster, the ``Dup0'' column indicates the presence of increased copy number in any of the genes in the cluster. Where this is larger than the sum of known alleles, it suggests the presence of uncharacterised CNV alleles. ``Del'' alleles in Ace1 represent secondary deletions within the Ace1-Dup1 CNV.}

	\caption{\footnotesize Haplotype clustering of the genomic region around \textit{Cyp6aa/Cyp6p} (top panel) showing that nearly all haplotypes belong to one of two selective sweeps. The less common cluster (cluster2) is predominantly found in Muleba and is not associated with CNVs. The more common cluster (cluster1), is found in both regions. Both \textit{Cyp6aap}\_Dup31 and \textit{Cyp6aap}\_Dup33 form a subset of haplotypes in cluster1. For \textit{Cyp6aap}\_Dup33, it was possible to assign presence (mauve) or absence (grey) of the CNV for each haplotype. For \textit{Cyp6aap}\_Dup31, it was only possible to determine whether the mosquito to which the haplotype belongs had a single extra copy (yellow), two (purple) or none (grey). A single extra copy indicates the sample is heterozygous for the CNV, and thus haplotypes labelled in yellow may not themselves carry the CNV. Similarly, in the \textit{Coeaexf} region (bottom panel), haplotypes bearing the CNV allele \textit{Coeaexf}\_Dup2 represented a subset of haplotypes from a large swept cluster. Clustering was performed using 500 SNPs in each region, and CNV alleles were phased by identifying SNPs that were highly correlated with their presence / absence.. Full workings to reproduce this analysis can be found at \url{https://github.com/vigg-lstm/GAARD\_east/blob/main/CNV\_analysis/sweeps}.}

Combining our data with all haplotypes from phase 3 of Ag1000G (top) shows \textit{An. arabiensis} haplotypes forming their own cluster, distinct from other species. When keeping only \textit{An. arabiensis} haplotypes (middle), three different \textit{Vgsc}-995F clusters are seen, despite only four such haplotypes exising in the dataset. The bottom plot shows all eight \textit{Vgsc}-995 mutant haplotypes (two from our Tanzanian data, six from phase3 samples from Burkina Faso) and a random sub-sample of wild-type \textit{An. arabiensis}, allowing a closer view of sample set labels for interpretation. The two Tanzanian \textit{Vgsc}-995F haplotypes appear to be independent origins, one of which clusters more closely with haplotypes from Burkina Faso than with other Tanzanian haplotypes. }

For $F_{ST}$, these are significant peaks which contained at least one haplotype significantly positively associated with resistance (Supplementary Data S2). For $\Delta H_{12}$ and PBS, these are significant positive peaks (ie: indicating stronger signals of selection in resistant compared to susceptible samples).

%\noindent {\footnotesize \textbf{Fig. S8} caption: Genomic windows of phenotypic association around \textit{Cyp9k1} were never at the \textit{Cyp9k1} locus itself. Plot shows $F_{ST}$ (red), $\Delta H_{12}$ (green) and PBS (blue), with shaded rectangles extending to the bead plot below indicating peaks that were significantly associated with resistance phenotype based on phenotype randomisations (there are the peaks summarised genome-wide in figure S4). Asterisks denote $\Delta H_{12}$ and PBS peaks determined by outlier analysis, with many being non-significant according to phenotype randomisations. These peaks may be caused by the presence of a selective sweep in the region, regardless of whether the sweep is associated with the phenotype. The positions of \textit{Cyp9k1}, NADH dehydrogenase (ubquinone) 1 $\beta$ subcomponent 1 (``NADH dehyd.'') and \textit{Cyp4g17} (discussed in the main text) are shown on the bead plot. }
