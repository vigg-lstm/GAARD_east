The bottom plot shows an example sample of \textit  {An. coluzzii} from Korle-Bu (Ghana), where the CNV extends far to the left, and into the region of erratic coverage to the right, thus meaning that we could not identify discordant reads that could tag individual CNV alleles in this population.\relax }}{8}{figure.caption.8}\protected@file@percent }
